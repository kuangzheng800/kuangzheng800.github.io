Hello world! 

I'm a young professional working in biotech, wrangling with NGS data from cancer patients. I'm also pursuing a master's degree in Data Science.

I'm interested in working with clinical and epidemiological data, as well as spatial and environmental analyses. Because...well my educational background is kind of a mess.

- Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Master of Science, Epidemiology & Exposure Risk
- Peking University, Bachelor of Science, Economics, Urban Studies

Wrangling data and running regression is fun, but also somewhat lonely :cry:. I mean I do have a life that my Terminal doesn't get to see, but hey, I thought my Terminal has something cool to share as well! So here it is, a data science journal to keep myself motivated and my progresses documented.

Remeber those times when you have no brackets after your `print`? Exactly. Memories fade faster than most of expect, but hey at least the webpage lives on.
